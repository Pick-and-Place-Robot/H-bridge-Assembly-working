## Overview

This project involves designing a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) that utilizes the ATmega328P microcontroller along with four DRV8825 stepper motor controllers to control stepper motors. The ATmega328P will be programmed to communicate with the 4 DRV8825 drivers to precisely control the movement of the stepper motors.
